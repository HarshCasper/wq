# wq.app 0.7.2

wq.app 0.7.2 brings a number of enhancements to [SCSS theme](https://wq.io/docs/jquery-mobile-scss-themes) support, including:
- A new [wq/swatches.scss](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/blob/master/scss/wq/swatches.scss) with a number of useful pre-defined theme swatches (including an approximation of jQuery Mobile 1.3's default theme)
- Compass and PySCSS are now automatically installed with wq.app so you don't need to download them separately (#34).

Check out the [Swatch Preview Tool](https://wq.io/wq.app/tests/swatches.html) to play around with the new themes.
